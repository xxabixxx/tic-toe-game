# tic-toe-game

This is a simple implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game in JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on any empty cell to place your mark (X or O).
3. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
